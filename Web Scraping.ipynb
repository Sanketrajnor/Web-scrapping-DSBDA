The keyboard does have a bit of a grainy texture and feels plasticky on my nails, that bothers me but I'm getting used to it. Setup is a pain on windows 11, with a billion opt outs/ins for basically advertising. At least you can say no though so just pay attention to what they're asking during setup. :/Aside from that though, I'm really happy with the computer. It's fast. I turned off S mode in the settings under activation. S mode prevents you from downloading anything not Microsoft approved, including other browsers. Quite frankly, S mode is only good for controlling a child's downloads in my opinion, but I wouldn't force edge on even a child. LolI only bought this for writing but it's far exceeded my speed expectations and size is nice and big even though the laptop is extremely light. I haven't tried but I do think it could handle some light gaming.I would definitely recommend getting it.\n",
